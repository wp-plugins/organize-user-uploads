== Description ==

**Sorry to those of you who downloaded this plugin before I had added the files to the repo.  But now they are avaliable and ready to help you organize those uploads.

A very simple plugin that organizes uploads into folders based on the current user id.

Example:

"/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image.jpg" becomes "/wp-content/uploads/$id/2011/01/image.jpg" where $id is the current users id.

or when uploads are not sorted into month and year:

"/wp-content/uploads/image.jpg" becomes "/wp-content/uploads/$id/image.jpg" where $id is the current users id.


== Installation ==

1. Extract 'uploads-by-user.php' and transfer it to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. All future uploads will be sorted by user id
